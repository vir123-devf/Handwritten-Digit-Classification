# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Classification (ANN)

This project performs handwritten digit classification using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses the MNIST dataset for digit recognition  
- Implements a fully connected **ANN model**  
- Input data normalization and label encoding  
- Model training with accuracy and loss visualizations  
- Evaluation on unseen test data  

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  

## 📁 Dataset

- **Dataset**: MNIST  
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images  
- Each image: 28x28 pixels, grayscale  
- Automatically loaded via `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist`
